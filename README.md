# Stock Price Prediction and Analysis 

The "Stock Price Prediction and Analysis" project is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the stock prices of various companies. The project uses time-series data and employs several models such as Auto ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM to predict future stock prices. It also includes a comprehensive analysis of the historical stock prices, exploring trends and patterns in the data. The project provides valuable insights into stock price prediction and analysis using machine learning techniques.
